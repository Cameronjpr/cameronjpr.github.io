I've seen a few projects like this one around the internet, and I wanted to create my own - as a learning exercise for P5.js and as a means of demystifying pathfinding algorithms. 

## The tool

[P5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a graphical library for JavaScript that lowers the technical bar to creative coding. 

## The brain

Dijkstra's is a famous pathfinding algorithm.

`some = () => code { return dog() }`
