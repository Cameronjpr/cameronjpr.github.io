## Beginnings

About one year ago, I taught myself to code. 

That's not strictly true – I had some prior experience with Swift, and Python _many_ years ago as a teenager, but 2019 was the year I decided programming is what I wanted to do with my working life, and that I would devote a large portion of my spare time to learning how. 

To the best of my memory, here's the complete list of everything I built in my first year as a coder: 

## Games

Tic Tac Toe

Escape!

Starboard

## Miscellaneous 

Dijkstra's algorithm visualiser

Smart Meeting Room Dashboard
